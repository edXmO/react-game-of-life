## Game-of-life

> The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton "Cellular automaton") devised by the British [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway "John Horton Conway") in 1970. It is a [zero-player game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-player_game "Zero-player game"), meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete "Turing complete") and can simulate a [universal constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_constructor) or any other [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine "Turing machine").
